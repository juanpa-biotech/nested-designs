# Files for R Tutorial: Analysis of results of a nested experimental design

Hello!

This is the repository for the post R Tutorial: Analysis of results of a nested experimental design. You can check it out here: https://juanpacarreon.com/posts/nested-designs/

A brief description of each file:

* data_plot.jpeg: final plot for the visualization of results from a nested design of experiments.
* data_simulation.R: an R script with the code for simulation of mice_data.csv. This is how I make the data for the post.
* mice_data.csv: data frame with treatments and response variable (expression levels).

Thanks a lot for read my post :)
